# My First Blog

Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, I will be discussing some interesting LaTeX formulas.

## Formula 1: Quadratic Equation

The quadratic equation is given by:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants.

## Formula 2: Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\( c \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (\( a \) and \( b \)):

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

## Formula 3: Euler's Identity

Euler's identity is a beautiful equation that relates five fundamental mathematical constants: \( e \), \( i \), \( \pi \), \( 0 \), and \( 1 \):

\[ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \]

These are just a few examples of the many fascinating LaTeX formulas out there. Stay tuned for more interesting topics in my upcoming blog posts!
